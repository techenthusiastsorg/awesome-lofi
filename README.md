# Awesome lofi

This list is not sorted in any particular order. Things will be moved in and out over time, and because it's version controlled, even if a track is removed, you can find it again in future.

We are looking for a player that will subscribe to a Slack channel and post automatic update to an awesome-list, as well as a media player that will go through a playlist on a github awesome-list page. If you know of one, let us know.

> People who show you new music are important.
